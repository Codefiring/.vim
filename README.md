# .vim
My own auto init vim config files

# Install
First, you need to clone this repository to your machine through using git.

    git clone https://github.com/codefiring/.vim

And then, copy the file `init.vim` to your home path. Remember to change it's name to `.vimrc`. You can use command as follow:

    cp init.vim ~/.vimrc

If everything goes right when you open vim, it will automatically start installing.

Otherwise, open vim using command `:PlugInstall` to finish initializing your vim config.
